The art gallery, filled with an array of modern art pieces, is buzzing with intellectuals, artists, and patrons. Amidst the crowd, Aurelia Wordsworth, a renowned art critic turned writer, locks horns in a debate with a renowned artist, their contrasting perspectives turning heads. Mortimer Greenleaf, the eccentric conservationist, observes their exchange from a distance, his deep, resonant voice occasionally breaking into his characteristic maniacal cackle."

The space is filled with stark white walls and clean lines, punctuated by the occasional abstract art piece. The studio's large windows allow a flood of natural light to illuminate the room, casting long shadows over the polished concrete floor. The room smells faintly of paint and varnish, a scent that mingles with the aroma of Felix's fresh garden soil. The two figures are seated comfortably on a plush, modern couch, their attention focused solely on each other."
