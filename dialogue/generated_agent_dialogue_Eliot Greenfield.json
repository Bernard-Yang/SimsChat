Eliot Greenfield, a Civil Designer with a passion for sustainability, stands in a corner of the store, surrounded by a small group of people. He is engaged in a discussion about a book on sustainable architecture, his voice echoing through the stacks. On the other side of the bookstore, Rex Strummer, a solitary figure with a knack for stealth, browses through the crime section, his deep, gravelly voice occasionally breaking the silence as he comments on his finds."

In my opinion, this is a direction worth considering in the quest for sustainable design."
