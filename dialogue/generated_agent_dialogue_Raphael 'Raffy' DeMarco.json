Raffy is engaged in a lively discussion about the latest indie films with the barista, a young woman with a bright smile and a keen interest in cinema. Meanwhile, Eliot Finch, a tech-savvy environmentalist, is seated at a table not too far away, engrossed in sketching out a blueprint for his latest project.
