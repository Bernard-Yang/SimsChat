His deep, resonant voice echoes through the area, punctuated by the occasional sounds of animals in the background. He's speaking about the importance of preserving animal habitats - his words ring out clearly in the quiet dusk. Elijah 'Eli' Sterling, a tech guru with a love for gaming, stands slightly off to the side, listening to Mortimer's speech with interest. His arms are crossed over his chest, and his eyes reflect the orange hue of the setting sun."

And despite our best efforts, he never truly recovered. Raja's story is not unique. It's a story that's playing out across the globe, every single day."
