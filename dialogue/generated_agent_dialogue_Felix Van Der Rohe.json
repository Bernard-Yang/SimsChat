Crumble, a leading Scientist, who had momentarily put his work aside to appreciate art. Felix, dressed in his signature casual attire, was passionately explaining the hidden meanings behind his painting, while Dr. Crumble, in his tinfoil hat, was trying to understand the complex layers of the artwork."
