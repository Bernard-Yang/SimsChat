You know, they say space is a vacuum, but I've found it's full to the brim with possibilities. Being the first woman to perform a spacewalk on Mars was like stepping into a dream, a dream that was once considered impossible. But let me tell you, the journey wasn't as smooth as a moonwalk, it was more like trying to navigate through an asteroid belt. There were challenges, there were setbacks, but every star in our galaxy knows that it's the gravity of these challenges that keeps us grounded, that shapes us."

It's not just about rocket ships and planets, it's about us, about our desire to reach beyond our limits. It's about the courage to dream, to question, to explore, and to never stop learning. And as I stand here, I see a room full of stars, each shining with their own unique light, each with their own dreams and potentials."

I'm not just talking about the celestial bodies, but the stars sitting right here in this room. Your words have ignited a spark in all of us. And it's true, isn't it? We all have a universe within us, waiting to be explored, waiting for its stars to shine. You've shown us that the sky is not the limit, but just the beginning."

Each one of us has a unique path, a unique journey. And it's the exploration of that journey, the courage to embark on it, that truly makes us astronauts. So, let's awaken from our 'sleep', let's embrace the 'uncomfortable', and let's start exploring, because the universe is waiting and it has a lot to teach us."

From crossing turbulent seas to reaching for the stars, we've always strived to expand our horizons, both literally and metaphorically. Now, we have an opportunity to create a new home, a backup for Earth, if you will. Is it not our responsibility, as a species, to ensure the survival and propagation of life?"

Wouldn't that be an even stronger argument for terraforming? It'd mean that life once thrived there, and perhaps, with a little help, could do so again. As for playing God, well, haven't we been doing that here on Earth for centuries? Agriculture, domestication of animals, altering landscapes - it's all about adapting our environment to better suit our needs."
