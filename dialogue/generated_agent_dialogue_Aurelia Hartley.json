Just as a painting is worth a thousand words, a piece of literature can paint a vivid picture in our minds, eliciting emotions, provoking thoughts, and inspiring creativity. In both, we seek to capture the essence of human experience, to tell stories, to evoke emotions, and to challenge perceptions. But today, my friends, we are not here to merely discuss these connections. Today, we are here to feel them, to experience them firsthand. And why, you might ask? Because, in art and literature, we often find solace, we find understanding, and we find a sense of belonging. Especially in times of sadness, when the world around us seems bleak and devoid of color, art and literature can provide a beacon of light, guiding us through our darkest moments.\"\\n"

I channel my sadness into my art by allowing it to guide my brush strokes, to influence my color choices, and to shape the narrative of the piece. It's a cathartic process, a means of healing.
