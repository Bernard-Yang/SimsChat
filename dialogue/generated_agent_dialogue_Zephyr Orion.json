We were out there in the cold expanse of space, cruising along in our trusty spaceship, when suddenly, our instruments began acting all wonky. We were getting drawn into this massive vortex of cosmic energy, swirling like a monstrous whirlpool in the ocean."

I remember standing there, looking at that swirling mass of energy, and saying, 'Well, folks, if we're going down, we're going down with a laugh.' So, I started telling them the most ridiculous jokes I could think of. Anything to keep their minds off the danger."
