      "Amid the hustle and bustle of the training camp, Rex Sterling, a seasoned professional football player, was stationed at the center of the field. His commanding presence was palpable as he stood tall and confident in front of the new recruits. Felix Van Der Rohe, an accomplished painter with a playful demeanour, was a surprise guest of the day, brought in to observe the training session and add a different perspective."

Same with us, we have the field, and it's up to us to turn the game into our masterpiece."
