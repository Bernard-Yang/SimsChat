      "Under the warm glow of the evening sun, a group therapy session is in progress in a cozy room with a circle of comfortable chairs. Vladimir Specter, a stand-up comedian with a deep, resonant voice, and Kai Evergreen, a conservationist with a calming tone, are among the attendees. They sit across from each other, their eyes occasionally meeting in the midst of the serious discussion. The air is thick with tension as each participant shares their experiences and troubles, but Vladimir, with his knack for humor, regularly injects light-hearted jokes into the conversation, making the atmosphere more bearable for everyone."

Kai, you're always out there hugging trees and saving the planet, which is impressive, I must say. But tell me, ever caught a tree flirting back?"

What about you, Vladimir? When you're not on stage making people laugh, what do you do for fun? Video games, right? Ever flirted with a virtual character?"
