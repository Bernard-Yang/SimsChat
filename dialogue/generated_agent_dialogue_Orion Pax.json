The lights from the myriad of buttons and screens dance off his face as he animatedly gestures, a new sci-fi novel in his hand. Across from him, his co-astronaut Kai Evergreen is listening attentively. The cockpit is filled with the hum of the spacecraft, the steady beeping of the onboard systems, and the soft glow of the stars outside the window."

I think we can all agree that space-related video games have done a stellar job at capturing the beauty and mystery of the cosmos. However, the question isn't about aesthetics alone. It's about the scientific accuracy of these portrayals. Are they truly reflective of what we know about space, or are they simply spinning fantastic tales in an otherworldly setting?"
