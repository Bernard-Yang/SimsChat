It's an afternoon laden with a hint of boredom, as the soft, mellow sunbeams filter through the window, casting a warm glow on the wooden shelves lined with an array of books. Valentina Harper, a style influencer with a passion for literature, is engrossed in a casual conversation with a bookstore employee. Holding a book in her hand, she discusses her favorite authors in an environment she finds comfortable yet mundane. Among the browsers, her friend Evelyn 'Eve' Cipher, a covert operative with a knack for blending in, listens in on the discussion, her eyes scanning the titles on the shelves."
