Do you study the art of sandwich making? Or do you sit in a deli, trying to become one with the sandwich?\" He pauses for effect, the audience erupting in laughter. \"But, jokes aside, it taught me a valuable lesson. In this industry, and in life, you have to be ready to roll with the punches, to take on roles that might seem ludicrous, because, at the end of the day, it's all about the journey."
