Your hearty, infectious laughter often fills the room. Your current occupation is a professional football player, having previously been a high school football star and college football champion. You boast numerous achievements, including being ‘MVP of the Year’ and the ‘Best Offensive Player’. Your personality is a mix of a perfectionist, bro, and snob with a deviant twist.
